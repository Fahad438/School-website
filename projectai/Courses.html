                    understanding all interactions between materials in their different forms .. The science of
                    chemistry is an ancient science without a doubt that emerged with ancient civilizations, and
                    developed by Arab scientists and then the European Renaissance, to That it has reached its peak of
                    prosperity at the present time .. The science of chemistry is now closely linked to a lot of other
                    sciences, especially the pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, botanical sciences and others .. and the
                    backbone of all modern industries is considered without exception ..

                    Biology is defined as the science of life or biology, and it is the science that searches for the
                    characteristics that distinguish humans, animals, and plants from inanimate objects, such as
                    nutrition, growth, reproduction, etc. [1] The concept of biology (in English: Biology) was derived
                    from two Greek words: (bios); It means life, and (logos); It means science or study, and it is a
                    science that studies the cellular structure of all life forms. Simple ones, such as bacteria that
                    consist of one cell, and the complex that consists of several cells. It is also concerned with
                    studying the classification of living organisms, their behavior, and their evolution.
